##  Beginner-Friendly Machine Learning Regression Analysis Portfolio Project: A Step-by-Step Guide
We are usin the Toyota Corolla CSV dataset for this machine learning regression analysis project. Regression analysis is a form of predictive modeling technique that investigates the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). It is used to predict continuous variables. For instance, in this project, we will be predicting the price of the car (Toyota Corolla) based on its 'Age', 'KM', 'FuelType', 'HP', 'MetColor', 'Automatic', 'CC',
Â 'Doors', 'Weight'. 

This dataset is clean and does not contain null values or unnecessary columns. Full step by step guide
